## SoBlock

SoBlock is a sparse voxel octree block building game. So it's like minecraft, but you can see the whole map (no fog) and build/destroy with arbitrarily large blocks. The blocks that are far away are rendered coarser so that the whole map fit in memory.

Here is a video of what it looks like:
